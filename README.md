# Code Supplements for FOCUS

This Github respository maintains the codes and experiments presented in our paper ["Counterfactual Forecasting for Panel Data"](https://github.com/navonildeb/navonildeb.github.io/blob/master/files/focus_preprint.pdf). The instructions for reproducibility of all the figures in the paper are given in `Vignette.pdf` that is generated from `Vignette.Rmd`. If the user wants to generate the data and reproduce the experiments from the scratch, the option `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = FALSE)` in line 11 of `Vignette.Rmd`.
